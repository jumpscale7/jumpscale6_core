# Welcome

This is the getting started page for OpenWizzy.
OpenWizzy is a branch from what used to be Pylabs. About 5 years ago Pylabs was the basis of a cloud automation product which was acquired by SUN Microsystems from a company called Q-Layer. 
In the mean time we are 3 versions further and we rebranded to OpenWizzy.

Please visit www.openwizzy.org & www.openwizzy.com for more information about our products.
